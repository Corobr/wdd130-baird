        The Song of Resonance
    </h1>
    <p>
        In Halveth, magic is not spoken or read; it is performed through music and song. Every inanimate object possess a unique "soultone" or a more complex “soulsong" for living things that defines its existence. Magic on Halveth consists of using resonance to affect these soutones which will in turn affect the physical world. This process is called tuning. While Resonance is the source of all life and light, channeling it directly is perilous. it can corrupt the user and drive them toward madness. To use Resonance safely, or at least, more safely, Tideborn heroes form deep, magical bonds with specific animals or objects. These bonds allow them to channel Resonance, granting them powerful abilities and defining their role in society

        <h2>Pathsingers</h2>
        <p>
          These are the scouts of Halveth. They form bonds with one of the many giant birds. Because of the migrating ocean, One of the most common animal types on Halveth is bird. There are birds of all different sizes ranging from Stonelights, small fat stone-like birds, to a Ravenluxes, giant ravens, large enough to carry a Tideborn. An unbonded Ravenlux is dangerous because they can snatch up a Tideborn like an eagle snatches a mouse . Ravenluxes are the most common type of pathsinger bird. Once bonded, they become fiercely loyal and more intelligent. To bond a Ravenlux is no trivial task requiring dangerous retrieval of the egg of a Ravenlux. The bond grants some physical changes to the pathsinger and the ability to hear the tones of Halveth feeling the best path moving forward. It also grants a greater resistance to the corruption of resonance which allows some ability to tune.

        <h2>Nighters</h2>
        <p>
          Night Riders, nicknamed the Nighters by most, are Tideborn who leave the relative safety of the Kavethi to “ride in the night” or the darkness away from kavethi. They bond beautiful glowing horses that roam the night, wild and untamed. Most of these horses are not able to be bonded, and one must usually join one of the nighter crews to bond one. The crew will wander until they find a hot spring to stay at for a short season. In order to bond, one of the horses must have a colt, which must drink from the spring, while the crew sings ritualistic songs of bonding. The prospective nighter will then bond the young colt for life. Through the bond, Nighters become gifted navigators and powerful illusionists. They specialize in hearing the “soulsongs" of people, which eventually leads to them often spotting a liar just by listening to their soulsong. Like the pathsinger bond, a nighter bond grants a greater resistance to the corruption of resonance allows for some ability to tune.

        <h2>Sanari</h2>
        <p>
          Sanari are Tideborn who form bonds with Sani, Large lion sized glowing felines. Sanari are often solitary not unlike their feline partners. There will usually only be one or 2 found on each kaveth.  Once they have bonded they focus on manipulating, or tuning, soulsongs to heal and support. They heal wounds outside of battle, and will sing “battle songs of coordination” that help other Tideborn soldiers work together. The method of bonding a sanna is a closely guarded secret known only to the Sanari. On occasion a sanara will choose a favored Tideborn initiate to become their apprentice., leaving their kaveth for an extended period of time. They return with their apprentice bonded to a new Sanna. Like the bond of a pathsinger and nighter, this bond grants a greater resistance to the corruption of resonance which allows them to use resonance to tune soulsongs.

        <h2>Echoblades</h2>
        <p>
          The name of both the weapon and the Tideborn, an Echoblade is a force to be reckoned with in battle. An Echoblade is a weapon forged from the rare Echostone found in the debris of volcanic eruptions. Once this is forged into a weapon, a Tideborn can form a bond with the new Echoblade. Unlike the other bonds, this bond does not change the physical appearance of the user very much. An Echoblade is most powerful where resonance is high. Their Echoblade clenses and purifies the resonance making it safe for them to channel although the process is terribly inefficient, requiring immense amounts of Resonance for them to channel. An Echoblade channels this resonance to increase their physical ability, allowing them to do super human things. In battle the shear force of an Echoblade is greatly feared.
