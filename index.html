      <h1>Welcome to Halveth</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Halveth, a fantasy world of perpetual twilight set on a moon that orbits a massive, glowing gas giant. There is no sun; instead, all light comes from drifting, glowing clouds and the natural luminescence of life itself. This glow is fueled by a magical energy called Resonance: which infuses the world, is stored in water, and causes all living things, from the plants and animals to the people themselves, to glow.

        <h2>A World in Motion</h2>
        <p>
          The inhabitants of this world are the Tideborn, a nomadic people who live in cities built upon the backs of Kavethi. These are enormous, intelligent beasts that are essential for survival, providing mobility, protection, and a spiritual connection for their people. The Tideborn are in constant migration for one crucial reason: to escape the ocean. The ocean constantly moves across the moon, glowing brightly, beautiful, deadly, and filled with corruption.

        <h2>The Duality Resonance</h2>
        <p>
          The core conflict of Halveth stems from its magic. On Halveth resonance is needed to be able to survive, but for some unknown reason the use of resonance corrupts its user, slowly driving them towards madness until they reach a point of no return known as dissonance. To combat this the Tideborn form bonds with some select animals.
          
          This corrupting energy creates monsters, most terrifyingly the Nakori—massive, violent creatures that were once Kavethi, but have lost their minds and souls to the Resonance. For the Tideborn, light is life, and the darkness is deeply feared for the threats it conceals.
